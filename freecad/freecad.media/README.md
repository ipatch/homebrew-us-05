A directory of media files aiding in the documentation process while working with freecad.

---

The **freecad.building.documentation** directory contains images pertaining to building the inline / offline local documentation files.  The offline documentation files are coupled with the **Assistant.app** of the QT suite, and can be built / packaged independently from the actual FreeCAD app.

Building the offline documentation is useful if one wants to use the **what is this** feature of FreeCAD, as of right now (August 2020) the prebuilt FreeCAD release **0.19_pre XXX** does not come bundled with the offline documentation, thus rendering the **what is this** feature of FreeCAD inoperable.
